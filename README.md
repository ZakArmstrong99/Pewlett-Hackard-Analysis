# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to generate csvs containing the titles of Pewleett Hackard employees retiring, each employees unique title, and the count of how many employees are retiring. Another goal of the analysis was to find the employees who are eligible for a mentorship. All of this was done in order to be prepared for the next wave of retiring employees. Using PostgreSQL with pgAdmin, a database was created that contains all the necessary data to make queries and tables for the analysis.
